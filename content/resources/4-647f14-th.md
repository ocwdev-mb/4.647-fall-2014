description: 'Benares, India: Silk industry. A young boy uses his head-the armature
  for intelligence-quite literally as he transports a bundle of punched-data cards-another
  form of embedded intelligence-down a brick walkway, to be fitted onto Jacquard weaving
  machines to print out new design patterns for saris. This course will consider some
  of the key ways in which questions of technology have been absorbed into architectural
  and cultural practice. Image courtesy of Arindam Dutta. Used with permission.'
