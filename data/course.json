  "course_description": "Twentieth and twenty-first century architecture is defined by its rhetorical subservience to something called \"technology.\" Architecture relates to technology in multiple forms, as the organizational basis of society, as production system, as formal inspiration, as mode of temporization, as communicational vehicle, and so on. Managerial or \"systems-based\" paradigms for societal, industrial and governmental organization have routinely percolated into architecture's considerations, at its various scales from the urban to the domestic, of the relationships of parts to wholes.\n",
